In this assignment, we created a simple ReactJS frontend application that demonstrates the use of react-router-dom for routing between three different pages: Home, About Us, and Contact Us. The project structure is organized to include separate CSS files for each page, ensuring modular and maintainable code. The application uses HashRouter for routing to meet the requirement for Elvis.

Steps to Build the Application:

Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Create a New React App: npx create-react-app my-assignment-3

cd my-assignment-3

Step 2: Install React Router

npm install react-router-dom
